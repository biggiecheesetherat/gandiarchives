# Gandi Archives
Welcome to Gandi Archives! A Github repo with useful Gandi extensions, with both the original and a version that can be used in places like TurboWarp (I call these importable extensions).
## Work in Progress
The project is WIP. Making a pull request with extensions importable extensions, or even the README is very much appreciated.
## Note to the Gandi devs
If you guys wish for this to not be up, we will take it down.
